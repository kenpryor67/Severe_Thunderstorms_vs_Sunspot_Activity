# Severe_Thunderstorms_vs_Sunspot_Activity
Python weather analysis application that compares the occurrence of severe thunderstorm activity occurring over the continental Unites States (CONUS) to daily international sunspot number measurements. 

## Project Overview:  
December 2019 was confirmed as the starting point of the new solar activity cycle, in which sunspot activity was observed to be at an 11-year minimum. Through the winter and spring of 2020, sunspot number gradually increased with corresponding significant severe thunderstorm outbreaks occurring in the continental United States (CONUS) during February and April 2020.

## Project Goal: 
This study investigates and derives a functional relationship (i.e., correlation) between sunspot number and severe thunderstorm activity over CONUS during the cold season, and compares to the results of previous studies, especially work as published at the Max Planck Institute (Schlegel et al. 2001). The following research questions are addressed:
1. What is the relationship between sunspot number and cold-season severe thunderstorm frequency?
2. How can this relationship be quantified, modeled, and assessed?

## Abstract - Motivation and Background:
The reference date and amplitudes of the minima and maxima of the 11-year solar cycle are established based on the sunspot number maintained and distributed by the SILSO World Datacenter since 1981 at the Royal Observatory of Belgium. Sunspots are dark areas that become apparent at the Sun's photosphere due to intense upward-forced magnetic flux from further within the solar interior. Heating areas along the magnetic flux in the upper photosphere and chromosphere become visible as faculae, causing cooler (7000 F), less dense, and darker areas at the core of these magnetic fields than in the surrounding photosphere (10,000 F). The resulting visible phenomenon is thus seen as sunspots. Active regions associated with sunspot groups are usually visible as bright enhancements in the corona at EUV and X-ray wavelengths.  Clette et al. (2014) provide a historical review and perspective of the development and evolution of sunspot number calculation techniques, most notably the International Sunspot Number.  Recent studies of the potential impact of sunspot activity on global weather and climate patterns have identified relationships between sunspot number and, collectively, south Asian Monsoon rainfall patterns (Rao 1976) and thunderstorm activity over central Europe (Schlegel et al. 2001).  Schlegel et al. (2001), based on a comparison of monthly-averaged sunspot number and lightning stroke frequency, inferred a significant functional relationship between sunspot number and thunderstorm activity over central Europe (R > 0.53, see Figure 2 below). However, this study only focused on warm-season (i.e., April to September) thunderstorm occurrence. Thunderstorm outbreaks during the cold season of the year (i.e., the months of November through March/April) typically occur in environments with limited amounts of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and solar heating of the earth's surface. Cold-season severe thunderstorms are often generated by the release of potential instability by large-scale forcing. Thus, another enhancing factor for cold-season severe thunderstorms should be explored to describe storm outbreaks on a regional scale. The period from January to April 2020 exhibited several thunderstorm episodes that increased in magnitude with the new solar cycle's commencement.
